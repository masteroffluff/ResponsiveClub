                        <h2>LET THERE BE MEAT…..</h2><br>
                        <p>RED MEAT is the solo Industrial infused techno project of Rhys Hughes ded.pixel, and former Modulate Live Member. Taking influence from Wax Trax! pioneers like Revolting Cocks, Meat Beat Manifesto and Sister Machine Gun, and adding a healthy slab of unrestrained queer rage to mix along with punishing techno beats and a dominating physical presence on stage. RED MEAT is a sound entirely out, proud and beating it’s own drum. Angry, sweaty, queer noise from a council estate in the North of England. Hard, dirty, and in your face!</p><br>
